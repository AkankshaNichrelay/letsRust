Well this was supposed to be
a poem by Emily Dickinson
But I thought of not go look for it
because I might just keep browsing.
Then I thought of writing my own poem.
But again would be too time consuming.
So instead, I just wrote this text and
split it randomly in a poem format that
Matches Emily Dickinson. Not that I know
much about one of my favorite poet.
I like the one about volcano Vesuvius 
and also theone about thoughts staying true
cant recall names. Oh well I guess I just spent
too much time writing this now. Should have copied instead.
Oh well. Plus this is too long for Emily Dickinson style.
